### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Once you're set up and can compile the sample Flutter app, you're ready to run some examples!

Each project is stored in its own folder in the repository. Using your IDE of choice, open the project root directory you'd like to run. Then, using the terminal inside your IDE, run `flutter pub get` to fetch any dependencies, and `flutter run` to deploy to your connected device or simulator.

If you would like to try these for Flutter for web, you can use `flutter run -d chrome`. For more information on enabling Flutter for web follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).
